Good-Cheap-Fast

Project description:

All complex systems are difficult to model, and the software development process is no exception. This
very simple app can be used to easily and quickly demonstrate to customers how changes to any of a
projects constraints (Fast/Cood/Cheap will affect the other constraints of the project.
In this project, the goal is to create a simple app to help customers to decide what is the best option for
their projects. The main screen of the app is to show Good, Fast, and Cheap options along with a
message for a user to pick two out of three. When the user selects two options he is to be able to click
the button GENERATE DIAGRAM in order to get a short report with the pros and cons of the selected
options, and a picture with a Venn diagram (consisting of two options).
Note: A venn diagrom is an illustration thot uses circles to show the relationships among things or
finite groups of things, Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that do not overlap do not
shore those troits. Venn diagrams help to visually represent the similarities and differences between
two concepts.

Project features:

FastCheap: Fast and Cheap venn diagram with text

GoodCheap: Good and Cheap venn diagram with text

GoodFast: Good Fast venn diagram with text

GoodCheapFast: main logic with the three circles on the main page, validation logic

Validation: modal for validation

App.js: Routes of all components

index.css: CSS of the project

Built with:

-HTML -CSS -JS -React JS

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
